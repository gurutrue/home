    "## Folder Size Scanner for Subdirectories\n",
    "\n",
    "This script scans all **subdirectories inside a specific folder** and prints the size of each one in a human-readable format (KB, MB, GB, etc). It's designed to help you quickly see which folders are using the most space inside a media library, project directory, or any other folder with multiple subfolders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the Script Does\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Target Folder Selection**  \n",
    "   The user sets a path to the folder they want to scan by updating the `target_folder` variable. This should point to a specific directory, not a drive root. For example:  \n",
    "   `\"E:\\\\TV SHOWS\\\\\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scan Subdirectories Only**  \n",
    "   The script loops through just the **top-level subfolders** inside the selected folder. It does not scan the drive or other unrelated directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate Folder Sizes**  \n",
    "   For each subdirectory, it uses `os.walk()` to recursively sum up the sizes of all files inside that folder (including files in subfolders).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Convert to Readable Format**  \n",
    "   The total size in bytes is converted to a human-friendly format like GB or MB using a simple helper function.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Print Results**  \n",
    "   The folder name and size are printed out one by one so you can quickly see which subdirectories take up the most space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use This Script?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Great for managing large collections like movies, TV shows, or project folders.\n",
    "- Helps spot which folders are using the most disk space.\n",
    "- Easy to customize and run on any directory by changing one variable.\n",
    "- Works directly in Jupyter Notebooks or as a standalone Python script.\n",
